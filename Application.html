          <p>O&O Defrag is one of the best and most famous programs for defragmenting hard drives. It was developed by the German company O&O Software GmbH, 
		  which is famous for the quality of its products and has long been creating various software related to disk drives. 
		  In this defragmenter, I like the beautiful and thoughtful interface, the fine settings with which experienced users will be able to place their files in the way that they themselves think is right, 
		  and not the program. Of course, there are optimal presets for average users, there are a scheduler, reports, statistics and other functions that should be present in any good defragmenter..</p>

          <p>I usually do not build VPNs , as the network is full of free extensions and promotions where you can easily get a long-term key or account (I publish these on the site and in our telegram channel ), 
		  but this time I made an exception because of the easy and A quick way to reset the traffic counter. If you do not download tens of gigabytes per day, then this assembly is just right. And for your convenience, the counter reset utility is built directly into the program interface. 
		  As for VPN , everything is standard: enough countries, the function of disconnecting the network connection when the connection with the VPN is disconnectedserver, acceptable speed. At the same time, you can block malicious sites and content,
		  but today these concepts mean different things for software developers and ordinary users, so it's up to you..</p>

          <p>Internet Download Manager - perhaps the best download manager to date, able to speed up downloads several times. Probably, you, as a specialist, will say, “No la la, I have megabits pizza, it will not accelerate anything!” That is true, but many sites limit the speed to one stream, however, they allow downloading to several of these streams. Do you understand what I'm getting at? Yes, exactly, your browser downloads in one stream, and this program in several, hence the acceleration. Moreover, IDM is very flexible in configuring, it will help you to download your favorite vidosos from YouTube, contactee and other supported video services, has a grabber of sites (no, you won’t be able to download anything forbidden, don’t dream), a schedule, a speed limiter and other useful goodies. I use this rocking chair and I advise you. Grab it soon!</p>
